# CONTRIBUTING

Happy you made it here! At some point we hope to have a road map
and a clear list of objectives here. Until then, please get in touch
by creating a new [issue](https://github.com/elgw/deconwolf/issues).

Some planned changes are listed in [TODO.md](TODO.md), there are
typically a few points marked with **help wanted**, maybe you know how
to handle them?

Getting started
===============

**deconwolf**\  [1]_ is a software for 3-D deconvolution of fluorescent
wide-field images:

- The deconvolved images shows very mild boundary effects which means
  that relatively small regions of interest can be used.

- RAM usage can be reduced at the cost of slightly longer computation
  times by tiling. That makes it possible to deconvolve large images
  on small machines.

- Critical parts run on separate threads (as many as you would
  like). However, for maximal throughput (and if you have enough RAM),
  run several instances of dw in parallel.

- It is shipped with a program to generate Point Spread Functions
  (PSFs) according to the Born and Wolf model. Our program is the only
  one we know of that actually integrate the PSF over each pixel.

- The programs are developed under Linux but can be compiled on Mac
  and Windows as well.

- Fully open source. And we embrace `contributions and suggestions
  <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__.

Deconwolf does not:

- Have a full-featured Graphical User Interface (GUI), however, if you
  like to click buttons there is a limited `GUI
  <https://github.com/elgw/deconwolf-gui>`__.

- Show your images, for that, try `ImageJ
  <https://imagej.net/Welcome>`__

- Diagnose your imaging system and correct for typical CMOS or CCD
  artifacts.

- Estimate your PSF based on real images.

- Tell you how many iterations that you should use although there are
  three ways to make it stop i) after a fixed number of
  iterations ii) when the progress is slow, or iii) at a fixed
  difference between the input image and the current guess (convolved
  with the PSF).

- If you miss one or more of these features, or just want something
  else, there is an (incomplete) list of `alternative
  <#aternatives>`__ software.

After building and installing you will find two binaries: - **dw** – for
deconvolution, `man page <doc/dw.txt>`__ - **dw_bw** – to create PSFs
using the Born-Wolf model `man page <doc/dw_bw.txt>`__


Method
------

The deconvolution algorithm is based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) method
[2]_ [3]_. The scaled heavy ball (SHB)  [4]_ is used for acceleration,
i.e. to do more work per iteration. Compared to the “Biggs”
acceleration, it use less memory, it also has a proven convergence
without any modifications to the algorithm.

The default boundary handling method is based on  [5]_ , although
extended to 3D. In our experiments it cause the least artifacts close to
the image borders, especially important in the axial direction. To
disable boundary handling, i.e. use periodic deconvolution, the option
**–periodic** can be used.

The PSF calculations in **dw_bw** implements the “Born and Wolf” model
[6]_ which is also decribed well in  [7]_. It is possible to speed up
the calculations using the method from  [8]_ using the **–li** argument.
At some point (after some more testing) it might become the default
method. An important difference to the
`PSFGenerator <https://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms/psfgenerator/>`__ is
that each pixel in the PSF is integrated full, rather than just using
one sample at the pixel centre. This modification gives measureable
improvements, especially when the pixel size to resolution limit is low.
**dw psf** also contains a few other PSF models which eventually will be
documented as well.

For GPU calculations dw use `VkFFT <https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT>`__
[9]_ via OpenCL. Until version 0.3.6
`libclfft2 <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT>`__ was used for
this purpose. Since OpenCL is vendor neutral, this option should work
for all major GPU brands. On the CPU side
`FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/>`__ is used, although it can of
course be swapped with API compatible alternatives like MKL.

Build and install
-----------------

Deconwolf runs on 64-bit machines with, both aarch64 and x86_64, and
require no special hardware. For some platforms there are pre-compiled
binaries available, see
`releases <https://github.com/elgw/deconwolf/releases>`__.

To compile and install deconwolf should take less than a minute on a
Linux machine but might be more cumbersome on MacOS and Windows. For
platform specific build instructions, see `INSTALL.md <INSTALL.md>`__.
We hope to provide pre-compiled binaries in the future.

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deconwolf uses:

-  `FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/>`__ for Fourier Transforms. Or
   alternatively Intel MKL.
-  `libtiff <https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff>`__ to read and write
   TIFF files.
-  `GNU Scientific Library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`__ for
   integration and special functions.
-  `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`__ for *automatic* parallelization
   of code, used in **dw**.
- `libPNG <http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>`__ for input and output of PNG images.

If these libraries are available for your platform, chances are that
deconwolf can be built as well.

To enable GPU acceleration, deconwolf also requires a GPU and OpenCL
drivers installed.

Performance hints
-----------------

The performance depends on the system and the image size. Except for
some initialization (read images, padding, cropping … ) and writing the
output, the time is linear with the number of iterations.

Here is a table with performance figures for some real images. Run on a
system with: a 4-core Intel i7-6700K CPU, 64 GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce RTX
3090, using the **–gpu** flag and 50 iterations (**–iter 50**).

======== ============ ============= ======== ============
software image size   job size      time (s) sys-mem (Mb)
======== ============ ============= ======== ============
dw 1.3.7 2048x2048x35 2228x2228x103 37       28,748

dw 1.3.7 512x512x35   692x692x103   4        7,564
======== ============ ============= ======== ============

Running only on the CPU the throughput drops drastically on this
machine, having only 4 cores:

======== ============ ============= ======== ============
software image size   job size      time (s) sys-mem (Mb)
======== ============ ============= ======== ============
dw 1.3.7 2048x2048x35 2228x2228x103 1,079    10,802
dw 1.3.7 1024x1024x35 1204x1204x103 222      3,300
dw 1.3.7 512x512x35   692x692x103   78       1,238
======== ============ ============= ======== ============

Yes, deconvolution is time consuming without a GPU :(

Below there will be some hints on the performance relative to other
software. For that purpose synthetic data will be used where periodic
boundary conditions (**–periodic**) can be used. dw should not try to
crop the PSF (which is usually done automatically to save some
memory/gain some speed) in this case, hence the flag **–xyfactor 0** is
added as well.

Benchmarking is performed on the `microtubules
image <https://bigwww.epfl.ch/deconvolution/data/microtubules/>`__ using
the accompanying PSF. Please note that it does not simulate “real” wide
field data very well since it is created by periodic convolution.

System: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS, AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor, 64 GB
RAM, 12 GB RX 6700 XT GPU. Iterations: 115.

Notes:

-  sys-mem is measured by parsing the **VmPeak** value from
   ``/proc/pid/status``. In the case of DeconvolutionLab2 the values
   does not necessarily reflect the required memory since it is written
   in Java which is garbage collected. For MATLAB/deconvlucy the memory
   includes the full MATLAB environment.

-  self-mem is the memory usage reported by the software if available.

-  DeconlutionLab2 use vanilla RL, i.e. without any acceleration which
   means that more iterations will be needed before convergence.

-  MATLAB/deconvlucy use “Biggs” acceleration. Matlab version R2020b was
   used in this case.

-  For “real” data, when **–periodic** is not used, the input image is
   padded automagically during processing and the relevant part is
   cropped out at the end.

-  Also works on Raspberry PI5 :) In that case it took 146 s.

Installation
------------

These instructions should work under Linux, BSD, Windows (via WSL), and
MacOS.

1. Get the dependencies. The required libraries should be found on most
   platforms, however, the installation process differs slightly. See
   `INSTALL.md <INSTALL.md>`__ for per-platform advice.

2. Compile and install

.. code:: shell

   mkdir builddir
   cd builddir
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   sudo make install

Once again, see :doc`install` for more options.

Minimal usage example
---------------------

To generate a parametric PSF and deconvolve an image, all you need is
something like this:

.. code:: shell

   # generate PSF.tif
   dw_bw --resxy 130 \
   --resz 250 \
   --NA 1.46 \
   --ni 1.518 \
   --lambda 460 PSF.tiff
   # Deconvolve image.tiff -> dw_image.tiff
   dw --iter 50 image.tiff PSF.tiff

For available options, please see

.. code:: shell

   dw --help
   dw_bw --help

To validate that **dw** does not create random garbage, run it on
``/demo/dapi_001.tif``

.. code:: shell

   cd demo
   make
   imagej dapi_001.tif dw_dapi_001.tif

The run time on an AMD 3700x was 8s. To use GPU accelerated
deconvolution, test

.. code:: shell

   dw --iter 20 dapi_001.tif PSF_dapi.tif --gpu --prefix dwgpu

The results should be visually identical.

For more documentation see the short `usage guide <usage.rst>`__, and the
manual pages for both binaries, `man dw <doc/dw.txt>`__ `man
dw_bw <doc/dw_bw.txt>`__.

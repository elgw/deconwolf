# deconwolf v0.4.1

**deconwolf**[^9] is a software for 3-D deconvolution of fluorescent wide-field
images:
 - The deconvolved images shows very mild boundary effects which means
   that relatively small regions of interest can be used.
 - RAM usage can be reduced at the cost of slightly longer computation times by
   tiling. That makes it possible to deconvolve large images on small machines.
 - Critical parts run on separate threads (as many as you would
   like). However, for maximal throughput (and if you have enough
   RAM), run several instances of dw in parallel.
 - It is shipped with program to generate Point Spread Functions (PSFs)
   according to the Born and Wolf model. Our program is the only one we
   know of that actually integrate the PSF over each pixel.
 - The programs are developed under Linux but can be compiled on Mac
   and Windows as well.
 - Fully open source. And we embrace [contributions and
   suggestions](CONTRIBUTING.md).


Deconwolf does not:
 - Have a full-featured Graphical User Interface (GUI), however, if you
   like to click buttons there is a limited
   [GUI](https://github.com/elgw/deconwolf-gui).
 - Show your images, for that, try [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Welcome)
 - Diagnose your imaging system and correct for typical CMOS or CCD
   artifacts.
 - Estimate your PSF based on real images.
 - Tell you how many iterations that you should use although there are
   three ways to make it stop i) after a fixed number of iterations
   ii) when the progress is slow, or iii) at a fixed difference
   between the input image and the current guess (convolved with the PSF).
 - If you miss one or more of these features,
   or just want something else, there is an (incomplete)
   list of [alternative](#aternatives) software.

Except for this README.me there is also a short [USAGE.md](USAGE.md),
a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and a [TODO.md](TODO.md).

After building and installing you will find two binaries:
 - **dw** -- for deconvolution, [man page](doc/dw.txt)
 - **dw_bw** -- to create PSFs using the Born-Wolf model [man page](doc/dw_bw.txt)

At the moment we don't provide pre-built packages. You will have to build
deconwolf from the source code, instructions follows below.

## Method

The deconvolution algorithm is based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL)
method [^2][^3]. The scaled heavy ball (SHB) [^4] is used for
acceleration, i.e. to do more work per iteration. Compared to the
"Biggs" acceleration, it use less memory, it also has a proven
convergence without any modifications to the algorithm.

The default boundary handling method is based on [^1] , although
extended to 3D. In our experiments it cause the least artifacts close
to the image borders, especially important in the axial direction. To
disable boundary handling, i.e. use periodic deconvolution, the option
**--periodic** can be used.

The PSF calculations in **dw_bw** implements the "Born and Wolf" model
[^5] which is also decribed well in [^6]. It is possible to speed up
the calculations using the method from [^7] using the **--li**
argument. At some point (after some more testing) it might become the
default method. An important difference to the
[PSFGenerator](https://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms/psfgenerator/) is
that each pixel in the PSF is integrated full, rather than just using
one sample at the pixel centre. This modification gives measureable
improvements, especially when the pixel size to resolution limit is
low. **dw psf** also contains a few other PSF models which eventually
will be documented as well.

For GPU calculations dw use [VkFFT](https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT) [^8]
via OpenCL. Until version 0.3.6
[libclfft2](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT) was used for
this purpose. Since OpenCL is vendor neutral, this option should work
for all major GPU brands. On the CPU side
[FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/) is used, although it can of
course be swapped with API compatible alternatives like MKL.


## Build and install
Deconwolf runs on 64-bit machines with, both aarch64 and x86_64, and
require no special hardware. To compile and install deconwolf should
take less than a minute on a Linux machine but might be more
cumbersome on MacOS and Windows. For platform specific build
instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).  We hope to provide
pre-compiled binaries in the future.

### Dependencies
Deconwolf uses:

 * [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/) for Fourier Transforms. Or
   alternatively Intel MKL.
 * [libtiff](https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff) to read and write TIFF files.
 * [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for
   integration and special functions.
 * [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) for _automatic_ parallelization
   of code, used in **dw**.

If these libraries are available for your platform, chances are that
deconwolf can be built as well.

To enable GPU acceleration, deconwolf also requires a GPU and OpenCL
drivers installed.

### Performance hints

The performance depends on the system and the image size. Except for
some initialization (read images, padding, cropping ... ) and writing
the output, the time is linear with the number of iterations.

Here is a table with performance figures for some real images. Run on
a system with: a 4-core Intel i7-6700K CPU, 64 GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090,
using the **--gpu** flag and 50 iterations (**--iter 50**).

| software |   image size |      job size | time (s) | sys-mem (Mb)  |
| :------- | :----------: | :-----------: | -------: | ------------: |
| dw 1.3.7 | 2048x2048x35 | 2228x2228x103 |       37 |        28,748 |
| dw 1.3.7 | 1024x1024x35 | 1204x1204x103 |       11 |         9,686 |
| dw 1.3.7 | 512x512x35   |   692x692x103 |        4 |         7,564 |

Running only on the CPU the throughput drops drastically on this
machine, having only 4 cores:

| software |   image size |      job size | time (s) | sys-mem (Mb) |
| :------- | :----------: | :-----------: | -------: | -----------: |
| dw 1.3.7 | 2048x2048x35 | 2228x2228x103 |    1,079 |       10,802 |
| dw 1.3.7 | 1024x1024x35 | 1204x1204x103 |      222 |        3,300 |
| dw 1.3.7 | 512x512x35   |   692x692x103 |       78 |        1,238 |

Yes, deconvolution is time consuming without a GPU :(

Below there will be some hints on the performance relative to other
software. For that purpose synthetic data will be used where periodic
boundary conditions (**--periodic**) can be used. dw should not try to
crop the PSF (which is usually done automatically to save some
memory/gain some speed) in this case, hence the flag **--xyfactor 0** is
added as well.

Benchmarking is performed on the [microtubules
image](https://bigwww.epfl.ch/deconvolution/data/microtubules/) using
the accompanying PSF. Please note that it does not simulate "real"
wide field data very well since it is created by periodic convolution.

System: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS, AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor, 64 GB
RAM, 12 GB RX 6700 XT GPU. Iterations: 115.

Notes:

- sys-mem is measured by parsing the **VmPeak** value from
  `/proc/pid/status`. In the case of DeconvolutionLab2 the values does
  not necessarily reflect the required memory since it is written in
  Java which is garbage collected. For MATLAB/deconvlucy the memory
  includes the full MATLAB environment.

- self-mem is the memory usage reported by the software if available.

- DeconlutionLab2 use vanilla RL, i.e. without any acceleration which
means that more iterations will be needed before convergence.

- MATLAB/deconvlucy use "Biggs" acceleration. Matlab version R2020b
  was used in this case.

- For "real" data, when **--periodic** is not used, the input image is
  padded automagically during processing and the relevant part is
  cropped out at the end.

- Also works on Raspberry PI5 :) In that case it took 146 s.


### Installation
These instructions should work under Linux, BSD, Windows (via WSL),
and MacOS.

1. Get the dependencies. The required libraries should be found on
   most platforms, however, the installation process differs
   slightly. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for per-platform advice.

2. Compile and install

``` shell
mkdir builddir
cd builddir
cmake ..
cmake --build .
sudo make install
```
Once again, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for more options.

## Minimal usage example
To generate a parametric PSF and deconvolve an image, all you need is
something like this:

``` shell
# generate PSF.tif
dw_bw --resxy 130 \
--resz 250 \
--NA 1.46 \
--ni 1.518 \
--lambda 460 PSF.tiff
# Deconvolve image.tiff -> dw_image.tiff
dw --iter 50 image.tiff PSF.tiff
```
For available options, please see

``` shell
dw --help
dw_bw --help
```

To validate that **dw** does not create random garbage, run it on
`/demo/dapi_001.tif`


``` shell
cd demo
make
imagej dapi_001.tif dw_dapi_001.tif
```

The run time on an AMD 3700x was 8s. To use
GPU accelerated deconvolution, test

``` shell
dw --iter 20 dapi_001.tif PSF_dapi.tif --gpu --prefix dwgpu
```

The results should be visually identical.

For more documentation see the short [usage guide](USAGE.md), and the manual
pages for both binaries, [man dw](doc/dw.txt) [man dw_bw](doc/dw_bw.txt).

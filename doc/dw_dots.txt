NAME
       deconwolf dw is a tool for deconvolution of wide field microscopy stacks.

       dw dots is the module that can be used to detect dots in tif images and export them to a tsv file.  It uses a Lapla‐
       cian of Gaussian (LoG) filter for initial detection and can further fit the dots using a Gaussian model.

SYNOPSIS
       dw dots [OPTIONS] file1.tif file2.tif ...

OPTIONS
       The program will assume that the dots are diffraction limited.  The following arguments are required for the program
       to know how to set the filter sizes:

       --NA   Numerical Aperture

       --ni   refractive index

       --lambda
	      emission wave length (in nm)

       --dx   lateral pixel size of the image (not the sensor) in nm.

       --dz   axial pixel size / distance between the planes in the image.  Specified in nm.

       It is probably also a good idea to set:

       --fitting
	      Enable fitting of dots.  Note that this take much more time than the initial dot detection, especially if the
	      dots are large (in terms of pixels).

       --ndots
	      Specify  the max amount of dots that should be exported (and possiby fitted).  It is recommended that this is
	      set manually when fitting is enabled.

       --threads t
	      Set the number of computational threads to use.

       If the dots are larger than the diffraction limit, you can use the

       --swell parameter to hint how much larger they are.

       --swell s
	      Specify how much larger the dots are, relative to the diffraction limit, i.e. valid values are s ≤ 1.

       To have full control of the filter sizes, it is possible to set them explicitly (not reccomended) by  the  following
       options:

       --dog_ls
	      Lateral sigma for the LoG filter.

       --dot_as
	      Axial sigma for the LoG filter

       --fit_ls
	      Lateral sigma for the initial guess of the dot fitting routine.

       --fit_as
	      Axial sigma for the initial guess of the dot fitting routine.

       --overwrite
	      If specified existing files will be overwritten.

       The remaining options are:

       --fout file.tif
	      Write  out  the  filtered	 images (e.g. the LoG filtered image).	Only for debugging and only to be used when
	      there is just one input file.

       --help Show a brief help message

       --verbose
	      Set the verbosity level.

Method
       dw dots will read one 2D or 3D image at a time and will perform the following:

       • Filter the image with a −LoG filter, using settings either derived from the optical parameters or given explicitly
	 at command line.

       • Extract all local maxima, excluding pixels at the edges.

       • Sort the maxima according to the −LoG value.

       • Keep at most --ndots.

       • If --fitting is set, determine the dot locations with sub pixel accuracy.

       • Write the dots to a TSV file.

INPUT
       dw dots can read the same kind of files as dw.  It does look for log files from deconwolf, and if one is	 found	the
       input image is rescaled according to the log file.  It works with 2D as well as 3D images.

OUTPUT
       A TSV file will be generated per input file (.dots.tsv) as well as a log file (.dots.log.txt).  The TSV file will be
       sorted by the dot intensities.

NOTES
       • The LoG filter is implemented using symmetric mirroring at the image edges.  It is possible that there are too few
	 image planes for a 3D LoG filter, in that case try running the program on a 2D projection.

       • For  2D images the same columns will be seen in the output.  However the fitted z position as well as the fitted z
	 size will be set to 0.

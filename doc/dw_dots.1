.SH NAME
.PP
deconwolf \f[B]dw\f[R] is a tool for deconvolution of wide field
microscopy stacks.
.PP
\f[B]dw dots\f[R] is the module that can be used to detect dots in tif
images and export them to a tsv file.
It uses a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter for initial detection and
can further calculate full width half max (FWHM) by interpolation if
wanted.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]dw dots\f[R] [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]] file1.tif file2.tif \&...
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]--lsigma\f[R]
Lateral sigma for a Gaussian low pass filter or the LoG filter if
enabled.
.TP
\f[B]--asigma\f[R]
Axial sigma for a Gaussian low pass filter or the LoG filter if enabled.
.TP
\f[B]--overwrite\f[R]
If specified existing files will be overwritten.
.TP
\f[B]--threads t\f[R]
Set the number of computational threads to use.
.TP
\f[B]--fout file.tif\f[R]
Write out the filtered images (e.g.\ the LoG filtered image).
Only for debugging and only to be used when there is just one input
file.
.TP
\f[B]--ndots\f[R]
Specify the max amount of dots that should be exported.
.TP
\f[B]--help\f[R]
Show a brief help message
.TP
\f[B]--nthreads\f[R]
Specify the number of threads to use.
.TP
\f[B]--verbose\f[R]
Set the verbosity level.
.SH Method
.PP
\f[B]dw dots\f[R] will read one input image at a time and will perform
the following:
.IP \[bu] 2
Filter the image with LoG filter using the values specified by
\f[B]--lsigma\f[R] and \f[B]--asigma\f[R] (or automatically set if you
specify the optical parameters as described below).
.IP \[bu] 2
Extract all local maxima.
.IP \[bu] 2
Sort the maxima according to the dot intensity.
.IP \[bu] 2
Calculate the FWHM value for each dot in the lateral plane (by
intersection).
.IP \[bu] 2
Write out at most \f[B]--ndots\f[R] dots to a TSV file.
.SH INPUT
.PP
\f[B]dw dots\f[R] can read the same kind of files as \f[B]dw\f[R].
It does look for log files from deconwolf, and if one is found the input
image is rescaled according to the log file.
.PP
The size of the LoG filter is determined by lsigma and asigma, which
coincide with the zero crossings of the LoG.
If you don\[cq]t know how to set those values, then, as an alternative,
you can specify \f[B]--NA\f[R], \f[B]--ni\f[R], \f[B]--lambda\f[R],
\f[B]--dx\f[R] and \f[B]--dz\f[R] instead and those parameters will be
used to set the sigma values.
In that case sigma will be set to the fwhm in each direction.
That gives a filter that is slightly larger than what would be optimal
for diffraction limited dots.
.SH OUTPUT
.PP
A TSV file will be generated per input file (\f[C].dots.tsv\f[R]) as
well as a log file (\f[C].dots.log.txt\f[R]).
The TSV file will be sorted by the dot intensities.

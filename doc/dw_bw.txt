NAME
       dw_bw is a tool to generate Point Spread Functions according to the Born-Wolf model.

SYNOPSIS
       dw_bw [OPTIONS] psf.tif

OPTIONS
       --ni # Set the refractive index of the immersion media.

       --NA # Set the numerical aperture of the objective.

       --lambda #
	      Set the emission wavelength [nm].

       --resxy #
	      Set the pixel size [nm] in the lateral plane.

       --resz P
	      Set the pixel size/distance between planes in the axial direction.

       --size N
	      Set output size to N x N x P [pixels].  This should be set big enough so that the PSF cone isn’t cropped at the first and last slice of the PSF.

       P      Set output size to N x N x P [pixels].  P has to be an odd number.  Please not that P should be at least (2Z-1) where Z is the number of slices in the image to be
	      deconvolved

       --threads t
	      Set the number of computational threads to use.

       --overwrite
	      Overwrite the target if it exists.

       --li   Use Li’s method (our implementation) for the BW integral.	 About 2x faster for the default PSF size.  Not thoroughly tested.

       --version, -V
	      Show version information and quit.

       --verbose L
	      Set the verbosity level to L where 0=quiet, 1=default, 2=full.

       --help Show a short help message and quit.

OUTPUT
       A 32-bit float tif file along with a log file.

EXAMPLE
	      dw_bw --resxy 65 --resz 200 --NA 1.45 --ni 1.515 --lambda 466 PSF_DAPI.tif

       saves PSF_DAPI.tif and PSF_DAPI.tif.log.txt.
